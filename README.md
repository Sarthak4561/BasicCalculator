# BasicCalculator
A basic Calculator made with HTML and Vanilla JavaScript with basic CSS in it.

A basic HTML page which has simple buttons on. it with some classes specified to it 

With the help of java script we find the value to the each of the button and the values such as 2,-,*,3 these are stored in a string to evaluate further after we hit equal button 
So the expression might be string = 8*4 
So when we will evaluate it we will get the result, which we can show later to the output by using innerHTML
